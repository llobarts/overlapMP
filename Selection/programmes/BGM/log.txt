Analysis Description
--------------------
BGM (Bayesian Graphical Model) uses a maximum likelihood ancestral state
reconstruction to map substitution (non-synonymous only for coding data)
events to branches in the phylogeny and then analyzes the joint
distribution of the substitution map using a Bayesian graphical model
(network). Next, a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis is used to generate
a random sample of network structures from the posterior distribution
given the data. Each node in the network represents a codon site in the
alignment, and links (edges) between nodes indicate high posterior
support for correlated substitutions at the two sites over time, which
implies coevolution.
